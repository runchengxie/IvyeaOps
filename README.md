# IvyeaOps for eMAG

[简体中文](docs/zh-CN/readme.md)

A self-hosted eMAG RO operations workspace, forked from [Hector-xue/IvyeaOps](https://github.com/Hector-xue/IvyeaOps). The fork uses imported evidence for inspections, business summaries and local drafts. It retains the original platform tools under explicit legacy routes.

## Current capabilities

- Read-only eMAG RO collection for offers, selected seller/FBE orders, returns, invoices and VAT data.
- Versioned snapshots, deterministic manual audit reports, bounded change previews and run receipts.
- Administrator workspaces for inspection records, own-catalog research, plans and local Listing drafts.
- Local proposal approvals bound to the current snapshot and revision. Approval does not execute a marketplace change.
- Read-scoped MCP tools for snapshots, receipts and reports. Saving a local report requires a write-scoped token.
- A schedule preparation page with server-time previews and disabled plan export. No scheduler consumes these eMAG plan drafts.

Purchase costs, profit, recommended selling prices, market-wide search volume and competitor sales are unavailable. No eMAG listing, price, stock or order writer is exposed by these workflows. Browser chat and image translation require their configured providers. The deterministic audit CLI needs neither an open console page nor a model.

## Run from source

Source code is in `src/client` and `src/server`. Installers accept Python 3.9+ and Node.js 20+; CI builds use Node.js 22. The locally verified environment is Windows, Python 3.12.13, Node.js 24.22.1 and an installed `ivyea-agent` 1.16.9. Other CI matrix environments are configured, not independently verified by that local run.

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/manage.ps1 -Action install
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/manage.ps1 -Action start
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
bash scripts/manage.sh install
bash scripts/manage.sh start
```

Installers can install dependencies and optional components. Run them only when you intend those changes. For a command-resolution preview, use `-DryRun` on Windows or `--dry-run` on the Unix entry point. The standard application uses session authentication. A private local development adapter is not part of the distributed login flow.

No fork release containing these source changes is assumed to exist. Upstream release archives do not contain the fork's eMAG changes. Frozen Windows/macOS archives retain their internal `client/` and `server/` layout. Read the [installation and migration guide](docs/installation.md) before upgrading an existing source installation.

## Manual audit

From `src/server`, using its Python environment:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m app.emag_job_cli --store-id example-ro --from-latest
# Read-only network collection using saved Windows credentials
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m app.emag_job_cli --store-id example-ro --days 29
```

`example-ro` is a placeholder for your imported store label. Offline replay requires an existing snapshot and does not claim a fresh collection. Windows network collection reads the Generic Credential target `IvyeaOps/eMAG/RO`. Platform API permissions and IP allowlisting are still required.
